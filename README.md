# aoc2020

My solutions in Rust to https://adventofcode.com/2020, ❌ not finished as I got tired and stopped enjoying it.

Rust is a language that I enjoy using and have been following for a long time. Sadly I rarely have time to use it 😔 , but AOC is a good reason to refresh my skills in this language. Therefore do not expect much from my code 🙃 . I have also tried to spend sensible amount of time on those tasks and some were really hard.

Also I am adding asserts for results after correct solution for easier refactoring.
